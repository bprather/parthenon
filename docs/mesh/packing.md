# Packing Variables Accross the Entire Mesh

`Kokkos` kernel launches have a 6 microsecond overhead. For small
kernels that perform little work, this can be a perforamnce bottleneck
when each kernel is launched per meshblock. Parthenon therefore
provides the capability to combine variables into a single data
structure that spans all meshblocks, the `MeshPack`. 

## Creating a Mesh Pack

There are two methods for creating mesh packs, which are analogous to the `VariablePack` and `VariableFluxPack` available in [containers](../interface/containers.md).
```C++
template <typename... Args>
auto PackVariablesOnMesh(Mesh *pmesh, const std::string &container_name,
                         Args &&... args)
```
and
```C++
auto PackVariablesAndFluxesOnMesh(Mesh *pmesh, const std::string &container_name,
                                  Args &&... args)
```
The former packs only the variables, the latter packs in the variables and associated flux vectors.

The variatic arguments take exactly the same arguments as
`container.PackVariables` and `container.PackVariablesAndFluxes`. You
can pass in a metadata vector, a vector of names, and optionally IDs
and a map from names to indices. See
[here](../interface/containers.md) for more details.

## Data Layout

The Mesh Pack is indexable as a five-dimensional `Kokkos` view. The
slowest moving index indexes into a 4-dimensional `VariablePack`. The
next slowest indexes into a variable. The fastest three index into the
cells on a meshblock.

For example:
```C++
// pack all variables on the base container accross the whole mesh
auto meshpack = PackVariablesAndFluxes(pmesh, "base");
auto variablepack = meshpack(m); // Indexes into the m'th meshblock
auto var = meshpack(m,l); // Indexes into the k'th variable on the m'th MB
// The l'th variable in the i,j,k'th cell of the m'th meshblock
Real r = meshpack(m,l,k,j,i); 
```

For convenience, `MeshPack` also includes the following methods and fields:
```C++
// the IndexShape object describing the bounds of all blocks in the pack
IndexShape bounds = meshpack.cellbounds; 

// a 1D array of coords objects
auto coords = meshpack.coords(m); // gets the Coordinates_t object on the m'th MB

// The dimensionality of the simulation. Will be 1, 2, or 3.
// This is needed because components of the flux vector
// are only allocated for dimensions in use.
int ndim = meshpack.GetNdim();

// Get the sparse index of the n'th sparse variable in the pack.
int sparse = meshpack.GetSparse(n);

// The size of the n'th dimension of the pack
int dim = meshpack.GetDim(n);
```
